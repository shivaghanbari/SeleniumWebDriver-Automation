# Selenium WebDriver End-to-End (E2E) Test Automation

This project is a Python-based end-to-end (E2E) test automation framework using Selenium WebDriver. It follows the Page Object Model (POM) design pattern to ensure maintainability, scalability, and reusability of the test code. The framework is designed to test a fake website (with a fake host) and includes scenarios written in the test file, while variables and classes are defined in the model file.

# Project Overview
This project is designed to automate end-to-end testing for a fake website using Selenium WebDriver and Python. The framework follows the Page Object Model (POM) architecture, which separates test logic (scenarios) from page-specific logic (locators and actions). This separation makes the code more modular, easier to maintain, and reusable.

Key Features:
- Page Object Model (POM): Encapsulates page-specific logic in separate classes.

- Selenium WebDriver: Used for browser automation.

- Python: The programming language used for writing tests.

- Fake Website: The tests are written for a fake website (host is fake).
